## Description

`ft_printf` sends formatted output to stdout (standard output, usually the terminal). In this project, we have implemented some of the most used format specifiers like `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%%`. 

Additionally, I have also implemented the `#`, ` ` (space), and `+` flags. These flags allow for additional formatting options, making `ft_printf` a versatile tool for formatted output in C.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use va_arg and to code a function that can take multiple arguments. In most of the projects in the 42 curriculum, it's forbidden to use the actual printf, so this function is very helpful even though it doesn't have all the features of the actual printf.

## Installation Instructions

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Download the library**: You can clone the library from GitHub using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vpekdas/ft_printf.git
```

2. **Install a C compiler**: If you don't already have a C compiler installed, you will need one to build and use this library. You can install the [Clang compiler](https://clang.llvm.org).
   
- On a Mac, you should already have Clang installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tools. You can confirm this by running clang --version in your terminal. If it's not installed, you'll be prompted to install it.

- On a Linux machine, use the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install clang
  ```

## Usage Instructions

The files ending with bonus.c are identical to those that do not end with it. I have uploaded the same file under two different names to meet the requirements of 'Moulinette', an algorithm that automatically grades our projects

1. **Include the library in your project**: Add the following line at the top of your source code files:
```c
#include "../includes/ft_printf.h"
```

2. **Compile your project**: When compiling your project, you need to tell the compiler where to find libftprintf.a and to link against it. Here's an example:
```bash
clang your_program.c -LLibftprintf -lftprintf -o your_project_name
```

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features provided by `ft_printf`:

- **Basic Format Specifiers**: `ft_printf` supports the most commonly used format specifiers: `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%%`.

```c
ft_printf("String: %s, Character: %c, Pointer: %p, Decimal: %d, Integer: %i, Unsigned: %u, Hexadecimal: %x, Uppercase Hexadecimal: %X\n", 
"Hello", 'A', &num, 123, -123, 123, 255, 255);

ft_printf("Decimal: %+d, Octal: %#o, Hexadecimal: %#x\n", 123, 123, 123);
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided the possibility to complete this project. A special gratitude I give to the contributors of the following tester programs:

* [printfTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester)

These tester programs were instrumental in the development process. They not only helped me identify and correct errors quickly, but also introduced me to new testing methodologies and considerations I hadn't previously encountered. Their insights and expertise contributed significantly to the completion of this project.

## Contribution Guidelines

I welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vpekdas/libft.git
```

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on. Do not make changes directly on the master branch
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

4. **Make your changes**: Make your changes in the new branch. Ensure your code follows the [norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette).

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes regularly with clear, descriptive commit messages.
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

6. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

7. **Create a pull request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a new pull request against the master branch.
